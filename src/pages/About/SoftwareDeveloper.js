        Highly skilled and dedicated SQL Data Analyst at Apple with a strong focus on software development 
      and automation. Since joining in 2020, I've been instrumental in ensuring the accuracy and quality 
      of Apple Maps data globally.

      <p>
        My expertise lies in Python scripting, which I leverage to develop automated solutions for data fixes 
        and to streamline various management tasks within the Apple ecosystem. I'm currently leading the charge 
        on the Hiking Trails project for Apple Maps, a testament to my ability to tackle complex data challenges. 
        Beyond this, I've successfully fixed millions of map data points worldwide using in-house tools, 
        consistently upholding Apple's rigorous standards for data accuracy.

      <p>
        In addition to my data remediation work, I possess a proven track record in web development, 
        having created and deployed several internal webpages utilized by other Apple teams. 
        I specialize in combining React and Python Flask to build intuitive interfaces that effectively 
        interpret and visualize extracted data from Apple's internal systems. I excel at data extraction and 
        interpretation, transforming raw data into actionable insights through user-friendly web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a valued member of my team, I also take pride in my role as a trainer and onboarding specialist. 
        I've successfully trained numerous new teammates on the intricacies of SQL, Python, and various 
        in-house tools, ensuring a smooth and efficient integration into our team's workflow.
