      <h3>Coaching Experience</h3>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;I am currently the head coach of the <a href="https://www.valleyviewvbc.org/">Valley View Volleyball Club</a> (VVV) U13 team.
        I enjoyed working with new players and teaching the basics of volleyball.
        <br />
        These are my coaching philosophies:
        <ul>
          <li>My main goal as a coach is to help players discover and grow their love for the sport. Their passion, more than anything, will be their guiding foundation.</li>
          <li>I will always provide a safe space for my players. I expect everyone on the team to respect each other and treat each other with kindness.</li>
          <li>I'll always push my players for consistent growth all season long. Beyond just teaching them the sport, I'll guide them through the challenges and adversities that naturally come with being on a team, hoping these lessons help them navigate real-life situations too.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Certifications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Standard CPR/AED & First Aid - National Health and Safety Association</li>
          <li>SafeSport and IMPACT</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Player Experience</h3>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;In 2021, my friend invited me to play volleyball. I am the type of person who loves to try new things, so I decided to give it a shot. From there, I felt that passion
        about learning something new. The exponential growth that I am feeling about the experience all the more got me hooked on the sport. As I dedicate two to three days in a week on open
        gyms consistently, my skill got better and better. I've also joined whole day tournaments and played leagues indoors, on grass and on sand. To this day, I am still learning and improving on
        my skills as a volleyball player. Coaching also helps me break down my own skills and self-evaluate my own game. I am looking forward to more leagues and tournaments in the future.
